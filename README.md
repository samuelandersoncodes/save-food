# Save Food

Save Food is a web application pilot project that provides the platform for people to share food instead of throwing them away or leaving them to spoil. On the other hand, poeple are also able to view the posted food items and chat their owners for the food to be reserved and picked up at the given location.

# User-Experience-Design

## The-Strategy-Plane

### Site-Goals

The site is aimed at providing a platform for people to share food. Registered users are able to chat owners of the posted food items and through that confirm their reservation and later pick it up at the given location. 
Owners of food item posts are able to edit, delete and have a reserved status on their posts when necessary.

This is to help in reducing food wastage and greenhouse gas emmision as well as saving natural resources and the planet. In the end people get fed and it is a happier society.

### Agile Planning

This project was developed using agile methodologies by delivering small features in incremental sprints. There were 3 sprints in total, spaced out evenly over four and half weeks.

All projects were assigned to epics, prioritized chronologically as, Must have, should have and could haves. They were assigned to sprints and stories based on their level of complexity. Implementation was done in order of the aforementioned priority. It was done this way to ensure that all core requirements were completed first to give the project a complete feel, with the nice to have features being added should there be the capacity.

The Kanban board was created using github projects and can be located [here](https://github.com/users/samuelandersoncodes/projects/1) and can be viewed to see more information on the project cards. All stories except the documentation tasks have a full set of acceptance criteria in order to define the functionality that marks that story as complete.
